What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Making sure the document was clear, brief and had all the necessary information was what i feel confident about. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document was kind of like creating a roadmap or checklist. While coding I was always to able to make sure my overall code was on the right track and it made sure i did not add unecessary things to the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The Recommendation is the one part of the document that i feel like coud have been thought through better. While researching, i noticed that there are still many gaps in my knowledge, but with time constraints i was not able fill those gaps with more research. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
